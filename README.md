# Escape-Room-Python-Tkinter

My very first python project using tkinter to make and click escape room like game.
This was a project me and my friend made for our class for CS 2012 for Cal State La
It was my idea to start making an escape room concept so I used some screenshots of what I found in others game I played, I used the background and added our own gimick into solving these 3 rooms. I added clickable lables that are key to escape.

Solution: Some of labels are not exact, keep trying to click around where you think they are. The clock provides the time 06:13 which is the code for the box. The box gives you a lighter which can be placed in the fireplace. The fireplace gives you a doorknob, which can be used for the drawer without a knob. The drawer has a remote which can turn on the Tv. The Tv gives you a random code each time you play.
