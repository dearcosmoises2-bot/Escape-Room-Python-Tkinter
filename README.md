# Escape-Room-Python-Tkinter

My very first python project using tkinter to make and click escape room like game.
This was a project my friend and I made for our class for CS 2012 for Cal State La.
It was my idea to start making an escape room concept, so I used some screenshots of what I found in others game I played. I used the background and added our own gimick into solving these 3 rooms. I added clickable labels that are key to escape. It was his idea to customize the door lock and to implement sounds that we couldn't pull off.

Solution: Some of the labels are not exact; keep trying to click around where you think they are. The clock provides the time 06:13, which is the code for the box. The box gives you a lighter which can be placed in the fireplace. The fireplace gives you a doorknob, which can be used for the drawer without a knob. The drawer has a remote which can turn on the Tv. The Tv gives you a random code each time you play.
